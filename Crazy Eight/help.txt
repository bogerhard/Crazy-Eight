Each card played (other than an eight) must match the card showing on the starter pile, either in suit or in denomination.
Example: If the Q of Clubs is the starter, any club may be played on it or any Queen.
If unable to play, cards are drawn from the top of the stock until a play is possible, or until the stock is exhausted.
If unable to play when the stock is exhausted, the player must pass.
A player may draw from the stock, even though there may be a playable card in the playerâ€™s hand.
All eights are wild! That is, an eight may be played at any time in turn, and the player need only specify a suit for it (but never a number).
The next player must play either a card of the specified suit or an eight.
